**Fine-tuning Keras Language Models for Natural Language Inference Task**

Data science project using pre-trained NLP models to perform a logical inference task. Can a computer decipher if two sentences make sense together? Fine-tuned pretrained Keras NLP models like BERT, RoBERTa, and multi-lingual versions of each, as well as various sizes. Not sufficient training data to achieve state of the art accuracy on the NLI task.
